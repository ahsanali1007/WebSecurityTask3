# 🛡️ Task 3 – Web Application Security
**ApexPlanet Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship**

## 🎯 Objective
Identify and exploit **OWASP Top 10** web application vulnerabilities in a controlled lab environment using tools like **DVWA**, **Burp Suite**, and **Kali Linux**. Demonstrate both exploitation and mitigation techniques.

## 🔍 Key Work Done
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Performed SQLi on DVWA to extract usernames & passwords; demonstrated prevention using prepared statements.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Executed Stored and Reflected XSS attacks; applied input validation and Content Security Policy (CSP) as mitigation.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Created a CSRF exploit to change a user’s password in DVWA and implemented token-based protection.
- **File Inclusion (LFI & RFI)**: Tested local file inclusion to read sensitive files and remote file inclusion scenarios for code execution.
- **Burp Suite Advanced**: Intercepted and modified login requests; performed fuzzing with Intruder to find hidden inputs/endpoints.
- **Web Security Headers**: Evaluated headers using securityheaders.com and added/configured proper HTTP headers in Apache.

## 📦 Deliverables
- Security Testing Report (SQLi, XSS, CSRF) with screenshots  
- GitHub folder with attack scenarios, PoC scripts/snippets, and mitigation notes  
- 8-minute video demonstrating an exploitation and its fix

## 💡 Learning Outcome
Hands-on experience identifying and mitigating web application vulnerabilities; strengthened knowledge of OWASP Top 10, secure coding, and web-hardening practices using real tools in a safe lab setup.
